This is a unversale datahub. You can upload files to a static website and view the files that are downloaded. I use this with a RPI in one room and upload all my files to it remotly wether through port forwarding or localnetwork.

HOW TO GET WORKING:
[0] MAKE SURE NPM IS INSTALLED
[1] RUN NPM INSTALL
[2] RUN PYTHON3 main.py

This will run a nodejs server for the static files and uploading, while python will handle showing those files to other devices.
